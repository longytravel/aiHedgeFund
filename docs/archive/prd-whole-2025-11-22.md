## Executive Summary

AIHedgeFund is an autonomous multi-agent AI trading system that replicates institutional hedge fund decision-making at retail cost. Using a breakthrough 20-agent networked architecture with signal convergence, it systematically discovers and analyzes UK stock market opportunities on your schedule (default: overnight), delivering actionable trading decisions when and how you want them (default: morning report).

**The Problem:** Retail traders face systematic disadvantages—they can't monitor entire markets (FTSE All-Share = 600+ stocks), lack multi-perspective institutional analysis, suffer emotional bias, and miss opportunities happening outside their watchlist. Elite hedge funds deploy teams of specialized analysts, systematic processes, and 24/7 resources that cost £60,000-100,000+/year.

**The Solution:** A 20-agent AI system running on your schedule (default: overnight 1am-7am, fully configurable) that:
- **Discovers opportunities** via 7 configurable searcher agents (News Scanner, Insider Trading, Volume Spikes, Fundamental Screener, Earnings Surprises, Analyst Activity, Corporate Actions)
- **Analyzes from multiple perspectives** via 8 customizable expert investor agents (Buffett, Lynch, Burry, Naked Trader, Quality/Moat, Technical, Catalyst Detective, Sentiment)—enable/disable, weight, or add your own
- **Makes decisions** via Risk Manager + Portfolio Manager with adversarial challenge process
- **Delivers reports** at your preferred time/format (default: morning report by 7am via email), plus on-demand analysis anytime
- **Costs £100-200/month** vs. institutional £60k+/year (99.5% cost reduction)

**Three-Phase Path:**
- **Phase 1 (Months 1-3):** Prove profitability with £5-10k capital, 2-3 trades/week, 60%+ win rate
- **Phase 2 (Months 4-9):** Scale to £100k capital, 5-10 trades/week, 40%+ annualized returns
- **Phase 3 (Month 10+):** Launch as hedge fund or signal service

**Current Status:** Working US-focused system with 19 agents. Adapting for UK market with enhanced networked architecture, signal convergence system, and three-tier tracking innovation.

### What Makes This Special

**Core Differentiator:** Networked multi-agent architecture with signal convergence creates emergent intelligence at retail cost.

**Five Breakthrough Innovations:**

1. **Signal Convergence Network** (Industry First)
   - Agents broadcast/listen/react in dynamic network—NOT linear pipeline
   - Example: News Scanner spots catalyst → Industry Specialist confirms significance → Macro Economist identifies trend → Fundamental Screener finds peers → Technical Analyst sees breakout = **CONVERGENCE DETECTED**
   - Multiple independent signals converging on same stock = highest conviction
   - Signal scoring: Weighted by strength + diversity + macro multipliers
   - Filters noise from genuine opportunities

2. **Three-Tier Tracking System** (Watchlist Innovation)
   - **Tier 1 - Active Portfolio:** Current holdings, monitored for SELL signals
   - **Tier 2 - Active Watchlist:** Great stocks waiting for conditions ("Buy if drops to £8", "Buy if insider buying occurs") with **re-validation protocol** (prevents value traps)
   - **Tier 3 - Research Queue:** Stocks under investigation
   - Captures "almost good" opportunities that timing prevents from immediate entry
   - No missed opportunities from timing issues

3. **Adversarial Challenge Protocol** (Risk Management)
   - Before every BUY: Risk Manager + Contrarian Agent **force rigorous thesis defense**
   - Challenge questions: "What could go wrong?", "Why is the market wrong?", "Is this a value trap?"
   - Bull case agents respond to challenges
   - Result: Appropriately sized positions, tight stop-losses, prevents groupthink
   - Matches institutional investment committee processes

4. **Modular Agent Architecture** (Extensibility & Control)
   - Add, remove, or swap agents without code changes—complete plugin system
   - Enable/disable agents based on performance, cost, or strategy preferences
   - Configure agent weights: Emphasize value vs. growth vs. technical analysis
   - Custom agent library: Build your own investor personas
   - Examples:
     - Cost optimization: Disable expensive LLM agents during testing (60% cost reduction)
     - Strategy tuning: Run only value investing agents for dividend portfolio
     - Performance iteration: Remove underperforming agents, boost high-performers
     - Personal preference: "I don't trust technical analysis" → disable Technical Analyst
   - Supports rapid experimentation and continuous improvement
   - Future: Agent marketplace for sharing/selling custom investor personas

5. **Total Flexibility & Control** (User Empowerment)
   - **Schedule:** Morning, afternoon, multiple times daily, weekends, or on-demand anytime—not locked to 7am
   - **Scope:** Analyze entire market, specific sectors, custom ticker lists, or single stocks on demand
   - **Output:** Email, SMS, Slack, PDF, JSON—whatever format, whenever you want it
   - **Strategy:** Run multiple portfolios with different strategies simultaneously (ISA conservative, taxable aggressive)
   - **Execution:** Manual approval, auto-execute within guardrails, or paper trade mode
   - **Agents:** Enable/disable, weight, customize, add your own investor personas
   - **Result:** System adapts to YOUR life, YOUR strategy, YOUR preferences—not the other way around
   - Unlike rigid black-box robo-advisors that force you into their workflow

**Technical Foundation:**
- **LangGraph Orchestration:** Production-grade multi-agent workflow (used by Uber, LinkedIn, Elastic)
- **20-Agent Architecture:** 7 Discovery + 2-3 Macro/Sector + 8 Analysis + 2 Decision agents
- **Batch Processing:** Overnight 1am-7am processing (cost-effective vs. real-time)
- **Existing Codebase:** Working US system with FastAPI backend, React frontend, 19 agents already built

**Competitive Advantages:**
- **UK Market Specialization:** Less competition than US-focused tools, LSE retail data fee waiver (Jan 2025)
- **Research-Validated:** Architecture mirrors elite hedge funds ($400B+ AUM validated practices)
- **Cost-Effective:** £100-200/month vs. £60,000+/year institutional (99.5% cost reduction)
- **Modular & Extensible:** Unlike black-box robo-advisors, users control which agents run, adjust weights, build custom investor personas—complete transparency and customization
- **Total Flexibility:** On-demand analysis, custom schedules, multiple portfolios, any output format—system adapts to user's life and strategy, not vice versa
- **Scalable Path:** Personal use → Hedge fund → Signal service

**Domain:** Fintech (UK Stock Trading & Investment)
**Complexity:** HIGH

**Classification Rationale:**
- **Platform:** FastAPI backend + React frontend + LangGraph orchestration + 20-agent system + data processing pipelines
- **High Complexity Domain:** Financial trading, regulatory considerations (FCA), real-time data integration, LLM orchestration at scale
- **Unique Characteristics:** Not standard SaaS or web app—specialized AI agent orchestration platform with financial data integration

### Domain Context

**Fintech Domain - UK Stock Trading:**
- **Regulatory Environment:** Phase 1 (personal use) has minimal regulatory burden. Phase 3 (hedge fund launch) requires FCA authorization, compliance frameworks, and audit trails.
- **Market Characteristics:** London Stock Exchange (LSE), FTSE All-Share (~600 stocks), UK market hours 8:00 AM - 4:30 PM GMT
- **Data Requirements:** Real-time/delayed price data, financial statements, news feeds, insider trading disclosures, corporate actions
- **Cost Structures:** API costs (data + LLM), compute costs (overnight batch processing), trading costs (spreads, commissions)
- **Key Concerns:**
  - Data accuracy and timeliness (bad data = bad trades)
  - Security (API keys, trading credentials, portfolio data)
  - Audit trails (track all decisions for learning + potential regulatory compliance)
  - Risk management (position limits, stop-losses, max exposure controls)
  - Cost containment (LLM costs can spiral analyzing hundreds of stocks daily)

  - Adjust for volatility: High beta stocks get smaller size
  - Respect concentration limits: No more than 20% in single sector
- Set stop-loss levels:
  - Default: 8-12% below entry price
  - Tighter stops (5-8%) for low-conviction trades
  - Wider stops (12-15%) for high-conviction long-term plays
- Set target prices:
  - Calculate upside from valuation agent analysis
  - Set initial target at 50% of estimated upside (secure partial gains)
- Check portfolio constraints:
  - Total exposure ≤ 80% of capital (maintain cash buffer)
  - No single position > 10% of portfolio
  - Sector exposure ≤ 20% per sector
- Output: Approved/rejected recommendations with position sizing and risk parameters

**FR-2.4: Portfolio Management (Portfolio Manager Agent)**
- Input: Risk-approved recommendations
- Make final BUY/SELL/HOLD decisions:
  - BUY: 6+ agents bullish AND confidence > 65% AND passes risk checks
  - SELL: 6+ agents bearish OR stop-loss triggered OR target reached
  - HOLD: Mixed signals or insufficient conviction
- Generate trading orders:
  - Ticker symbol
  - Action (BUY/SELL)
  - Quantity (shares)
  - Order type (market, limit)
  - Stop-loss price
  - Target price
- Prioritize opportunities: Highest conviction stocks first if capital limited
- Output: Daily trading recommendations (0-3 new BUY orders typical)

**FR-2.5: Existing Position Monitoring**
- Check all current holdings daily:
  - Stop-loss breached? → Generate SELL order
  - Target price reached? → Generate partial SELL (50% of position)
  - Fundamental deterioration? → Re-run all agents, may trigger SELL
- Monitor watchlist stocks:
  - Price triggers reached? → Re-validate thesis, may trigger BUY
  - Event triggers occurred? (insider buying, earnings beat) → Re-analyze

**FR-2.6: Adversarial Challenge Protocol**
- Before any BUY recommendation reaches user, Risk Manager and Contrarian agents SHALL challenge the bullish thesis

- Bull case agents (Value, Growth, Quality, Catalyst Detective) SHALL respond to challenges with evidence-based rebuttals
- Portfolio Manager SHALL incorporate challenge outcomes into final decision:
  - Adjust position sizing based on identified risks
  - Set tighter stop-losses if downside risks significant

### FR-5: Data Management & Integration

**Philosophy:** Simplicity over complexity. Three specialized providers deliver institutional-grade UK data without the fragmentation, rate limit juggling, and maintenance overhead of multi-source aggregation.

**FR-5.1: 3-Tier Data Architecture**

System SHALL use a simplified three-tier data architecture optimized for UK market coverage, eliminating the complexity of managing multiple free APIs with inconsistent data quality and rate limits.

**Tier 1: Core Data Engine - EODHD All-In-One** (~£85/month)

**Provider:** EOD Historical Data (https://eodhd.com/)
**Plan:** All-In-One Package
**Cost:** ~£85/month ($99.99/month, or $999/year)

**Delivers:**
- **30-year historical price data:** OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) for 150,000+ tickers globally including comprehensive LSE and FTSE All-Share coverage
- **Deep fundamentals:** Income statements, balance sheets, cash flow statements (quarterly and annual) with 10+ years history
- **Financial ratios & metrics:** P/E, P/B, PEG, ROE, ROA, debt ratios, margins, growth rates—calculated and ready to use
- **Analyst estimates:** Consensus revenue estimates, EPS estimates, earnings trends, surprise data (normally £1000s/month from services like I/B/E/S)
- **Corporate actions:** Dividends, stock splits, buybacks, M&A announcements
- **Earnings calendar:** Upcoming and historical earnings dates with estimate vs. actual data
- **Macroeconomic indicators:** UK GDP, inflation (CPI), interest rates, unemployment—no need for separate macro API
- **Technical indicators:** Pre-calculated RSI, MACD, SMA, Bollinger Bands (optional—can also calculate locally)
- **100,000 API calls/day:** Generous quota eliminates rate limit concerns

**UK-Specific Strengths:**
- Native LSE support (exchange code: 'LSE', MIC: XLON)
- Handles UK quirks: pence vs. pounds pricing, IFRS accounting standards
- Comprehensive FTSE 100/250/All-Share coverage
- UK dividend data specifically validated and maintained

**Why This Replaces 5+ Free APIs:**
✅ Single source of truth for fundamentals—no data aggregation complexity
✅ No rate limit juggling across multiple providers
✅ Analyst estimates included (unique value at this price point)
✅ Consistent data quality—no US-centric bias issues
✅ One API integration to maintain instead of five

**Tier 2: Intelligence Layer - CityFALCON** (~£15-40/month)

**Provider:** CityFALCON (https://www.cityfalcon.ai/)
**Plan:** Personal Silver/Gold or Commercial Starter
**Cost:** ~£15-40/month depending on plan

**Delivers:**
- **UK RNS (Regulatory News Service) feed:** Official regulatory announcements from LSE-listed companies
- **Director dealings:** Properly parsed PDMR (Person Discharging Managerial Responsibilities) shareholding notifications—high-signal insider trading data
- **News sentiment scoring:** NLP-powered sentiment analysis trained specifically on financial text
- **Categorized news:** Automatic tagging (M&A, earnings, director dealings, trading updates, dividends)
- **Real-time alerts:** Push notifications for breaking RNS announcements

**UK-Specific Strengths:**
- Built FOR the UK market (not US-centric like most APIs)
- Understands UK regulatory structure (RNS vs. SEC filings)
- Parses unstructured RNS text into structured data
- Director dealings properly extracted (unlike generic APIs that only handle SEC Form 4)

**Why This Replaces Web Scraping + NewsAPI:**
✅ No fragile web scrapers to maintain (Investegate, LSE.co.uk)
✅ Professionally structured director dealings data—no text parsing required
✅ Sentiment scoring included—no need to build NLP engine
✅ Official RNS feed access—faster and more reliable than scraping
✅ Legal and compliant—no robots.txt or terms-of-service concerns

**Tier 3: Execution Layer - Interactive Brokers API** (~£10/month)

**Provider:** Interactive Brokers (https://www.interactivebrokers.com/)
**Integration:** IBKR API (Python library: `ib_insync`)
**Cost:** ~£10/month for LSE Level 1 market data subscription (standard brokerage account)

**Delivers:**
- **Real-time quotes:** Live bid/ask prices at point of trade execution
- **Order routing:** Direct order placement via API
- **Portfolio tracking:** Real-time position updates, P&L tracking
- **Trade confirmations:** Automated trade logging

**Why This Solves Real-Time Pricing:**
✅ You need a broker anyway—leverage their data feed
✅ Real-time data only required at execution, not for analysis
✅ Eliminates need for expensive standalone real-time API subscription
✅ Seamless execution workflow (analyze → decide → execute all via API)

**Strategic Rationale for 3-Tier Architecture:**

1. **Analysis uses delayed/EOD data** (EODHD): Fundamental strategies don't require real-time prices. Overnight batch processing analyzes valuation, trends, catalysts using historical data.

2. **Intelligence uses specialist UK source** (CityFALCON): RNS and director dealings are UK-specific. Generic global APIs fail here. CityFALCON solves the "UK data gap" problem.

3. **Execution uses broker feed** (IBKR): At the moment of trade, query broker for live quote. This decouples analysis (where 15-min delay is fine) from execution (where real-time matters).

**Total Monthly Cost:** ~£125/month for data (£85 + £30 + £10)
**Remaining budget:** £75/month for LLM API costs (plenty for 20-agent system analyzing 10-15 stocks/day)

**FR-5.2: Data Integration Implementation**

**EODHD Integration:**
```python
import requests

class EODHDClient:
    def __init__(self, api_key):
        self.api_key = api_key
        self.base_url = "https://eodhistoricaldata.com/api"

    def get_fundamentals(self, ticker):
        """Fetch complete fundamental data for UK stock"""
        url = f"{self.base_url}/fundamentals/{ticker}.LSE"
        params = {'api_token': self.api_key, 'fmt': 'json'}
        response = requests.get(url, params=params)
        return response.json()

            'earnings_annual': fundamentals.get('Earnings', {}).get('Annual'),
            'revenue_estimates': fundamentals.get('Earnings', {}).get('Trend')
        }
```

**CityFALCON Integration:**
```python
class CityFALCONClient:
    def __init__(self, api_key):
        self.api_key = api_key
        self.base_url = "https://api.cityfalcon.com/v0.2"

    def get_director_dealings(self, ticker, days=30):
        """Fetch recent director dealing announcements"""
        url = f"{self.base_url}/stories"
        params = {
            'access_token': self.api_key,
            'identifiers': f'{ticker}.LSE',
            'categories': 'dir',  # Director dealings category
            'time_filter': f'd{days}'  # Last N days
        }
        response = requests.get(url, params=params)
        stories = response.json().get('stories', [])

        # Filter for actual director dealings (buy/sell transactions)
        dealings = []
        for story in stories:
            if 'director' in story['title'].lower() or 'pdmr' in story['title'].lower():
                dealings.append({
                    'date': story['publishTime'],
                    'title': story['title'],
                    'url': story['url'],
                    'sentiment': story.get('score', 0)
                })
        return dealings

    def get_news_with_sentiment(self, ticker, days=7):
        """Fetch recent news with sentiment scores"""
        url = f"{self.base_url}/stories"
        params = {
            'access_token': self.api_key,
            'identifiers': f'{ticker}.LSE',
            'time_filter': f'd{days}',
            'languages': 'en'
        }
        response = requests.get(url, params=params)
        stories = response.json().get('stories', [])

        return [{
            'title': story['title'],
            'description': story.get('description', ''),
            'url': story['url'],
            'published': story['publishTime'],
            'sentiment_score': story.get('score', 0),  # CityFALCON proprietary score
            'source': story.get('source', {}).get('name')
        } for story in stories]
```

**IBKR Integration:**
```python
from ib_insync import IB, Stock

class IBKRClient:
    def __init__(self):
        self.ib = IB()

    def connect(self):
        """Connect to IBKR TWS or Gateway"""
        self.ib.connect('127.0.0.1', 7497, clientId=1)  # TWS paper trading

    def get_realtime_quote(self, ticker):
        """Get real-time bid/ask for execution"""
        contract = Stock(ticker, 'LSE', 'GBP')
        self.ib.qualifyContracts(contract)
        ticker_obj = self.ib.reqMktData(contract)
        self.ib.sleep(2)  # Wait for data

        return {
            'bid': ticker_obj.bid,
            'ask': ticker_obj.ask,
            'last': ticker_obj.last,
            'volume': ticker_obj.volume
        }

    def place_order(self, ticker, quantity, action='BUY', order_type='LMT', limit_price=None):
        """Place order via IBKR API"""
        from ib_insync import LimitOrder, MarketOrder

        contract = Stock(ticker, 'LSE', 'GBP')
        self.ib.qualifyContracts(contract)

        if order_type == 'LMT':
            order = LimitOrder(action, quantity, limit_price)
        else:
            order = MarketOrder(action, quantity)

        trade = self.ib.placeOrder(contract, order)
        return trade
```

**Ticker Format Handling:**
- **EODHD format:** `VOD.LSE` (ticker.exchange)
- **CityFALCON format:** `VOD.LSE` (same)
- **IBKR format:** `VOD` with exchange parameter `'LSE'`
- **Pence vs. Pounds:** EODHD returns prices in native format (some UK stocks in pence). System SHALL automatically detect and convert to pounds where needed for consistency.

---

**FR-5.3: Data Caching**

System SHALL implement aggressive caching to minimize API calls and costs.

**Caching Strategy:**

| **Data Type** | **TTL (Time To Live)** | **Refresh Trigger** | **Rationale** |
|---------------|------------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| **EOD Prices** | 24 hours | After market close (4:30 PM GMT) | EOD data doesn't change intraday |
| **Fundamentals** | 7 days | On earnings release | Financial statements update quarterly |
| **Analyst Estimates** | 7 days | On earnings release | Estimates update after earnings |
| **News** | 1 hour | None | News is time-sensitive |
| **Director Dealings** | 24 hours | Daily morning refresh (7 AM) | RNS released overnight |
| **Sentiment Scores** | 1 hour | None | Sentiment evolves intraday |
| **Macro Indicators** | 30 days | On official release dates | Macro data releases monthly/quarterly |
| **Real-time Quotes** | 0 (no cache) | Every request | Must be fresh for execution |

**Cache Implementation:**
- **Storage:** Redis (for production) or local file cache (for development)
- **Key Format:** `{data_type}:{ticker}:{date}:{params_hash}`
- **Example:** `fundamentals:VOD:2025-11-22:full`
- **Eviction Policy:** LRU (Least Recently Used) with max cache size 10 GB

**Cache Warming:**
- On system startup, warm cache with FTSE 100 fundamentals and recent prices
- During overnight batch run, refresh all cached data for watchlist stocks
- Result: Morning analysis runs use almost entirely cached data (fast, cost-effective)

---

**FR-5.4: Data Validation & Quality Checks**

System SHALL validate all incoming data to detect errors before they pollute analysis.

**Validation Rules:**

**Price Data:**
- Reject if price < 0 or price > £10,000 (likely error)
- Reject if single-day price change > 50% (check for stock split/corporate action first)
- Reject if volume < 0
- Flag if volume = 0 for multiple consecutive days (low liquidity warning)

**Fundamental Data:**
- Reject if critical fields missing (market cap, total debt, total equity)
- Flag if debt/equity ratio differs >10% between calculated and reported
- Flag if P/E ratio < 0 (negative earnings—loss-making company)
- Reject if earnings date in future but marked as "actual" (likely error)

**News/Sentiment Data:**
- Reject if timestamp > current time (future date impossible)
- Flag if sentiment score outside expected range (e.g., CityFALCON scores typically -1 to +1)

**Quality Check Workflow:**
1. Fetch data from API
2. Run validation rules
3. If validation fails:
   - Log error with ticker, data type, timestamp, reason
   - Try fallback source (if available)
   - If all sources fail, skip analysis for this stock with warning in report
4. If validation passes, cache and use data

**Audit Logging:**
- Log ALL data quality issues to database table: `data_quality_log`
- Fields: timestamp, ticker, data_type, source, issue_description, resolution
- Review monthly to identify systematic issues with providers

---

**FR-5.5: Audit Trail**

System SHALL maintain comprehensive audit trail of all data access and agent decisions for learning, debugging, and potential regulatory compliance.

**Audit Requirements:**

**Data Access Logging:**
- Log every API call:
  - Timestamp, provider (EODHD/CityFALCON/IBKR), endpoint, ticker(s) requested
  - Response status (success/failure), latency (milliseconds)
  - Cache hit/miss status
  - Cost (if applicable—track API quota usage)

**Agent Decision Logging:**
- Log every agent analysis:
  - Agent name, ticker analyzed, timestamp
  - Input data summary (price range, fundamentals snapshot, news count, sentiment score)
  - Output (signal: BUY/SELL/HOLD, confidence score 0-100, reasoning text)
  - LLM model used (GPT-4o, Claude-3.5, etc.)
  - Token usage (prompt tokens, completion tokens, cost)

**Trade Decision Logging:**
- Log Portfolio Manager decisions:
  - Timestamp, ticker, recommendation (BUY/SELL/HOLD)
  - Position size, entry price target, stop-loss, take-profit levels
  - Contributing signals (which agents voted BUY, signal strength)
  - Risk assessment (Risk Manager input)
  - User action (approved/rejected/modified)

**Execution Logging:**
- Log actual trades executed:
  - Timestamp, ticker, action (BUY/SELL), quantity, price
  - Order type (market/limit), fill status
  - Broker confirmation ID
  - Outcome after 30/60/90 days (profit/loss)

**Retention Policy:**
- **Data access logs:** 90 days
- **Agent decision logs:** 2 years (support learning and performance analysis)
- **Trade logs:** Permanent (regulatory requirement for hedge fund path)

**Storage:**
- Database tables: `api_call_log`, `agent_decision_log`, `trade_recommendation_log`, `execution_log`
- Indexed by: ticker, timestamp, agent_name for fast queries

**Reporting:**
- Weekly summary: Total API calls by provider, cost, success rate
- Monthly summary: Agent performance (win rate by agent), LLM cost breakdown
- Ad-hoc queries: "Show me all BUY recommendations for VOD in last 90 days"

---

**FR-5.6: Ad-Hoc Research Inbox**

System SHALL provide a designated file location for user to manually inject supplemental research not captured by automated data sources, supporting organic discovery of what research types matter before formalizing automation.

**Research Inbox Location:**
- **Path:** `/docs/research-inbox/`
- **Sub-folders:**
  - `/docs/research-inbox/[TICKER]/` — Ticker-specific research (e.g., `/docs/research-inbox/VOD/`)
  - `/docs/research-inbox/macro/` — Macro and sector research
  - `/docs/research-inbox/general/` — Uncategorized insights

**File Naming Convention:**
```

- BP_20251120_industry-outlook.md
- macro_20251119_BOE-policy-notes.txt
- general_ideas.md
```

**Supported Formats:**
- **Text files:** .txt, .md (plain text research notes, can include markdown formatting and URLs)
- **Documents:** .pdf (industry reports, analyst research, whitepapers)
- **Web content:** .html (saved web pages, archived articles)
- **Data files:** .csv (custom scraped data, comparison tables)

**Agent Integration:**

**When Agents Check Research Inbox:**
- **Portfolio Manager:** Before making final BUY decision, checks `/research-inbox/[TICKER]/` for files dated within last 30 days
- **Deep Analysis (On-Demand):** User can explicitly request: "Analyze VOD including research inbox"
- **Weekly Review:** Portfolio Manager checks `/research-inbox/macro/` during weekly portfolio positioning review

**Agent Behavior (Pseudocode):**
```python
def analyze_stock(ticker):
    # Standard automated data
    fundamentals = eodhd.get_fundamentals(ticker)
    news = cityfalcon.get_news(ticker, days=7)
    sentiment = cityfalcon.get_sentiment(ticker)

    # Check research inbox for supplemental user-provided research
    research_files = scan_research_inbox(ticker, days=30)

    additional_context = []
    if research_files:
        for file in research_files:
            content = read_file(file)  # Read PDF, txt, md, html, csv
            additional_context.append({
                'filename': file.name,
                'date': file.date_modified,
                'content': content[:5000]  # First 5000 chars to fit in LLM context
            })

    # Build LLM prompt with all available data
    prompt = f"""
    Analyze {ticker} using ALL available information:

    **Automated Data:**
    - Fundamentals: {format_fundamentals(fundamentals)}
    - Recent News: {format_news(news)}
    - Sentiment: {sentiment}

    **User-Provided Research (Research Inbox):**
    {format_research_context(additional_context) if additional_context else "No user research files found"}

    Provide BUY/SELL/HOLD recommendation.
    If user research contradicts automated data, explain the discrepancy and use your judgment.
    Cite sources (e.g., "According to user research file VOD_analysis.pdf...")
    """

    return llm.analyze(prompt)
```

**User Workflow Examples:**

**Scenario 1: Found Valuable Industry Report**
1. User discovers McKinsey report on UK telecom sector competitiveness
2. Saves as `/docs/research-inbox/VOD/VOD_20251122_mckinsey-telecom-report.pdf`
3. Next time system analyzes Vodafone (or user triggers on-demand analysis), agent reads PDF
4. Agent includes insight in recommendation: "Based on McKinsey telecom report (user research inbox), Vodafone faces intensifying competition from Three UK merger..."

**Scenario 2: Manual Deep Dive**
1. User spends weekend researching BP, saves notes to `/docs/research-inbox/BP/BP_20251120_energy-transition-thesis.md`
2. Monday morning, user runs: "Analyze BP, include research inbox"
3. Agent synthesizes: BP fundamentals + news + user's energy transition thesis → recommendation
4. Recommendation cites user research: "User's research highlights BP's undervalued offshore wind assets..."

**Scenario 3: Macro Positioning**
1. User reads Bank of England minutes, saves notes to `/docs/research-inbox/macro/BOE_20251119_rate-cut-signals.md`
2. During weekly portfolio review, Portfolio Manager checks macro folder
3. Agent: "User's BOE analysis suggests rate cuts coming Q2 2026 → favor rate-sensitive sectors (REITs, utilities)"

**Non-Goals (Phase 1 - Intentionally Simple):**
- ❌ Automatic URL fetching (user manually saves web pages for now)
- ❌ OCR for scanned images (text-based formats only)
- ❌ Automated categorization/tagging (simple folder structure sufficient)
- ❌ Research expiration/archiving (user manages manually)
- ❌ Integration with Zotero/Notion/etc. (just a file folder)

**Formalization Path (Future):**
After 3-6 months of usage, review research inbox to identify patterns:
- **Pattern:** "I keep adding competitor analysis PDFs" → Build Competitor Tracking Agent
- **Pattern:** "Lots of sector reports from Berenberg" → Integrate Berenberg research feed
- **Pattern:** "Many macro indicators from TradingEconomics" → Add TradingEconomics API
- **Pattern:** "Never used it" → Remove feature

This approach lets **real usage drive automation priorities** rather than speculating upfront about what research matters.

**FR-5.7: Fallback & Error Handling**

System SHALL implement graceful degradation when data sources fail, ensuring analysis can continue with partial data rather than complete failure.

**Fallback Strategy:**

**If EODHD Fails (Primary Source):**
1. Use cached data (up to 7 days old acceptable for fundamentals)
2. Alert user: "EODHD unavailable, using cached data from [date]. Recommendations may be stale."
3. Reduce analysis scope: Skip discovery scans, only monitor active portfolio for SELL signals
4. Continue execution: IBKR can still provide real-time quotes for trades

**If CityFALCON Fails (Intelligence Layer):**
1. Use cached news/sentiment (up to 24 hours old)
2. Skip director dealings analysis (no reliable fallback)
3. Alert user: "CityFALCON unavailable, director dealings signals unavailable today"
4. Continue with reduced signals: Fundamental and technical analysis still work

**If IBKR Fails (Execution Layer):**
1. **CRITICAL:** Cannot execute trades without broker connection
2. Alert user immediately: "IBKR connection lost. Manual execution required."
3. Provide manual execution instructions in report: "BUY 500 shares VOD at £0.72 or better"
4. User executes via IBKR web interface or phone

**Partial Data Handling:**
- If one stock's data fetch fails, skip that stock but continue analyzing others
- Report partial failures: "Analyzed 15/20 stocks. Failed: VOD (EODHD timeout), BP (no fundamentals), HSBC (data quality issue)"
- Never fail entire analysis run due to single stock failure

**Circuit Breaker Pattern:**
- If EODHD fails 3 consecutive times (3 days), send urgent alert: "EODHD persistently unavailable. Check API key, account status, service status."
- Temporarily reduce API call frequency if getting rate limit errors (back off)

**Error Logging:**
- Log all failures to `system_error_log` table: timestamp, component, error message, resolution
- Weekly review: Identify patterns (e.g., "CityFALCON timeout every Wednesday 2am" → adjust schedule)

- ✅ Easy to swap data sources without changing agent code
- ✅ Cross-validation possible (compare normalized data from different sources)
- ✅ Source attribution maintained (can trace back to origin)
- ✅ Adding new source = implement normalization, rest of system works automatically

### FR-6: Automation & Scheduling

  - **Timezone:** User's local timezone for all schedule times (default: GMT)
  - **Frequency:** Daily, multiple times per day, specific days only, or one-time future run
  - **Pause Mode:** Temporarily disable scheduled runs (vacation mode)
- Multiple scheduled runs per day:
  - Example 1: Morning scan 6am + Afternoon update 3pm
  - Example 2: Pre-market 7am + Mid-day 12pm + Pre-close 3pm
  - Each run can have different scope/configuration (e.g., morning = full market, afternoon = portfolio + watchlist only)
- One-time scheduled runs:
  - User can schedule analysis for specific future date/time ("Run full scan on 2025-12-01 at 9am")
  - Useful for earnings season, known catalyst dates, testing
- Pause mode configuration:
  - User can pause all scheduled runs (vacation, system changes, testing)
  - Specify pause duration (pause for 2 weeks, pause until specific date)
  - On-demand execution still available during pause
- Schedule SHALL be persisted in database and survive system restarts
