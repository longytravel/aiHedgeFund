# Product Brief: AIHedgeFund

**Date:** 2025-11-17
**Author:** Longy
**Context:** Platform (Brownfield - Method Track)

---

## Executive Summary

AIHedgeFund is an autonomous multi-agent AI trading system that replicates institutional hedge fund decision-making at retail cost. Using a breakthrough 20-agent networked architecture with signal convergence, it systematically discovers and analyzes UK stock market opportunities while you sleep, delivering actionable trading decisions each morning.

**The Core Innovation:** Unlike linear AI analysis tools, AIHedgeFund's agents communicate in a dynamic network—when one agent spots something, it triggers cascading analysis from others. Multiple independent signals converging on the same stock = highest conviction opportunities.

**The Vision:** Prove profitability with £5-10k capital (Phase 1), scale to £100k+ (Phase 2), then launch as a hedge fund or licensed investment service (Phase 3).

**Current Status:** Working US-focused system with 19 agents. Adapting for UK market with enhanced networked architecture and autonomous morning discovery workflow.

## Core Vision

### Problem Statement

**The Retail Trader's Dilemma:**

Manual stock research is time-intensive, emotionally exhausting, and systematically biased. Even experienced traders struggle with:

- **Coverage gaps:** Can't monitor entire market (FTSE All-Share = 600+ stocks)
- **Opportunity discovery:** Miss catalysts happening outside your watchlist
- **Analysis depth:** Lack institutional multi-perspective analysis
- **Emotional bias:** Fear, greed, and overconfidence cloud judgment
- **Time constraints:** Full-time jobs limit research hours
- **Information overload:** Can't process all news, filings, price action, sentiment
- **Inconsistency:** Analysis quality varies based on mood, fatigue, time pressure

**The Institutional Advantage:**

Elite hedge funds (Citadel, Bridgewater, Renaissance) deploy teams of specialized analysts, systematic processes, and multi-layered decision-making. They:
- Cover entire markets systematically
- Apply multiple investment philosophies simultaneously
- Cross-validate signals from diverse sources
- Remove emotional bias through structured workflows
- Operate 24/7 with resources retail traders can't match

**Cost:** Bloomberg Terminal alone = £24,000/year. Total institutional setup = £60,000-100,000+/year.

**Result:** Retail traders are systematically disadvantaged against institutions.

### Problem Impact

**For the solo retail trader (Longy's experience):**
- **Missed opportunities:** Great setups discovered too late or not at all
- **Analysis paralysis:** Overwhelmed by information, struggle to decide
- **Inconsistent returns:** Good streaks followed by poor decisions (emotional)
- **Time drain:** 10-20 hours/week researching vs. enjoying life
- **Capital inefficiency:** Hesitant to scale due to inconsistent process

**Market context:**
- 90% of retail traders underperform market benchmarks
- Average retail investor returns: 4-6% annually vs. S&P 500: 10%+
- Top hedge funds: 15-40% annualized returns with risk management

**Opportunity cost:** If £100,000 capital compounds at 5% (typical retail) vs. 30% (institutional-grade):
- 5 years: £127k vs. £371k = **£244k difference**
- 10 years: £162k vs. £1.37M = **£1.2M difference**

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

**Current Alternatives:**

1. **Stock Screeners (Finviz, TradingView)**
   - **Limitation:** Single-dimension filters, no multi-perspective analysis
   - **Gap:** Show WHAT is happening, not WHY or WHETHER to trade

2. **News Aggregators (Bloomberg, Reuters)**
   - **Limitation:** Information overload, no actionable recommendations
   - **Gap:** Still requires manual analysis and decision-making

3. **Robo-Advisors (Betterment, Wealthfront)**
   - **Limitation:** Passive index investing, no active stock selection
   - **Gap:** Can't capture alpha from individual opportunities

4. **Simple AI Stock Pickers (Trade Ideas, Stock Rover)**
   - **Limitation:** Pattern matching, no reasoning or context
   - **Gap:** Miss macro/sector context, catalyst detection, qualitative analysis

5. **Manual Analysis Tools (Simply Wall St)**
   - **Limitation:** Still requires YOU to do all the work
   - **Gap:** Time-intensive, emotionally taxing, inconsistent

**None combine:**
- ✅ Systematic market-wide discovery
- ✅ Multi-perspective institutional-grade analysis
- ✅ Qualitative reasoning (why/what could go wrong)
- ✅ Macro/sector context integration
- ✅ Autonomous operation (works while you sleep)
- ✅ Retail affordability (£100-200/month vs. £60k+/year)

### Proposed Solution

**AIHedgeFund: Institutional Intelligence, Retail Economics**

A 20-agent AI system that replicates how elite hedge funds research and select stocks, operating autonomously overnight to deliver actionable trading recommendations each morning.

**How It Works:**

**1. Discovery Layer (7 Searcher Agents)**
   - Systematically scan entire UK market overnight
   - Multiple independent trigger mechanisms:
     - News Scanner: Monitor UK financial news for catalysts
     - Insider Trading Agent: Track director dealings (high-signal)
     - Volume & Price Action Agent: Detect unusual activity
     - Fundamental Screener: Quantitative screens across FTSE All-Share
     - Earnings Surprise Agent: Monitor vs. expectations
     - Analyst Activity Agent: Track upgrades/downgrades
     - Corporate Actions Agent: Monitor buybacks, M&A, spinoffs

**2. Signal Convergence Network (Core Innovation)**
   - Agents BROADCAST discoveries to network
   - Agents LISTEN for relevant signals from others
   - Agents REACT by triggering cascading analysis
   - Multiple signals converging = highest conviction

   **Example:** News Scanner finds "Company X wins £500M contract" → Industry Specialist confirms sector significance → Macro Economist identifies infrastructure trend → Fundamental Screener finds undervalued peers → Technical Analyst sees breakout → **CONVERGENCE DETECTED** → Trigger deep analysis

**3. Macro/Sector Layer (2-3 Guide Agents)**
   - Macro Economist: Assess UK economic environment
   - Sector Rotation Agent: Identify favored/disfavored sectors
   - Industry Specialists: Deep sector expertise (optional)
   - Provide context multipliers for signal scoring

**4. Analysis Layer (8 Expert Agents)**
   - Value Investor (Buffett/Graham): Intrinsic value, moat analysis
   - Growth Investor (Peter Lynch): Growth sustainability assessment
   - Contrarian (Michael Burry): What's mispriced, what's the market missing
   - Naked Trader (Robbie Burns): Profitable + Growing + Low Debt checklist
   - Quality/Moat Agent: Competitive advantages, pricing power
   - Technical Analyst: Charts, patterns, momentum
   - Catalyst Detective: What specific event drives this higher?
   - Sentiment Analyst: News tone, positioning, social sentiment

**5. Adversarial Challenge System**
   - Before any BUY recommendation, Risk Manager and Contrarian challenge thesis:
     - "What could go wrong?"
     - "Why is the market wrong?"
     - "Is this a value trap?"
   - Bull case agents respond to challenges
   - Result: Appropriately sized positions, tight stop-losses, risk awareness

**6. Decision Layer (2 Decider Agents)**
   - Risk Manager: Downside analysis, position sizing, stop-losses
   - Portfolio Manager: Final synthesis, BUY/SELL/HOLD decisions

**7. Three-Tier Tracking System (Breakthrough Innovation)**
   - **Tier 1 - Active Portfolio:** Stocks owned, monitored for SELL signals
   - **Tier 2 - Active Watchlist:** Great stocks waiting for conditions
     - "Buy if price drops to £8"
     - "Buy if insider buying occurs"
     - "Buy after next earnings confirms growth"
     - **Critical:** Re-validate when conditions trigger (prevents value traps)
   - **Tier 3 - Research Queue:** Stocks currently being investigated

**Overnight Processing (1am-7am):**
- 1am: Data collection (prices, volumes, news, filings, insider trades)
- 2am: Discovery agents run, generate signals
- 3am: Signal aggregation, convergence scoring
- 4am: Deep analysis on high-scoring stocks, challenge process
- 5am: Watchlist processing, re-validation of triggers
- 6am: Portfolio review, check stops/targets
- **7am: Daily Report Delivered**

**Morning Routine (15-30 minutes):**
- Review 0-3 BUY recommendations
- Check watchlist alerts
- Approve/reject SELL recommendations
- Place trades

**Result:** Institutional-quality analysis, retail time commitment.

## Risks and Assumptions

### Key Assumptions

**Technical Assumptions:**
1. **LLMs can reason about stocks:** GPT-4/Claude Opus provide institutional-quality qualitative analysis
   - **Validation:** TradingAgents academic research confirms feasibility
   - **Risk:** Medium—LLMs may hallucinate or miss nuance
   - **Mitigation:** Multi-agent cross-validation, adversarial challenges, human final approval

2. **Multi-agent architecture outperforms single agent:** Specialized agents + signal convergence > monolithic system
   - **Validation:** Research confirms multi-perspective improves decisions
   - **Risk:** Low—hedge funds use multi-analyst teams for this reason
   - **Mitigation:** Backtest vs. single-agent baseline

3. **Signal convergence filters noise:** Multiple independent triggers = genuine opportunities
   - **Validation:** Institutional hedge funds use similar cross-validation
   - **Risk:** Medium—false positives possible
   - **Mitigation:** Tune thresholds with historical data, track false positive rate

4. **UK market data sufficient:** £16/month EODHD + free tiers = institutional-equivalent quality
   - **Validation:** Data sources research confirmed coverage and quality
   - **Risk:** Low—LSE official data available as fallback
   - **Mitigation:** Multi-source redundancy (EODHD → Finnhub → LSE)

5. **Batch processing adequate:** Overnight analysis (1am-7am) sufficient for short-to-medium term trading
   - **Validation:** Not day trading, 15-min delay acceptable
   - **Risk:** Low—strategy doesn't require real-time
   - **Mitigation:** Could upgrade to intraday if needed (Phase 2)

**Market Assumptions:**
6. **UK stock market provides alpha opportunities:** Inefficiencies exist for active traders to exploit
   - **Validation:** Hedge funds consistently beat benchmarks
   - **Risk:** Medium—retail may lack edge vs. institutions
   - **Mitigation:** Focus on less-covered FTSE 250/small caps, systematic coverage advantage

7. **News/signals predict price movements:** Catalysts identified by discovery agents lead to profitable trades
   - **Validation:** Event-driven hedge funds (Burry, Ackman) validate approach
   - **Risk:** Medium—markets may be efficient, signals already priced in
   - **Mitigation:** Speed advantage (overnight processing), multi-source convergence (unique combinations)

8. **Volume strategy viable:** 2-5 opportunities/week sustainable in UK market
   - **Validation:** FTSE All-Share (600+ stocks) × daily catalysts = sufficient flow
   - **Risk:** Low—even 1% of market = 6 stocks/week
   - **Mitigation:** Three-tier tracking captures overflow (watchlist queue)

**Business Assumptions:**
9. **Longy can execute trades profitably:** Human final approval doesn't degrade performance
   - **Validation:** Longy's trading experience
   - **Risk:** Low—system does analysis, Longy applies judgment
   - **Mitigation:** Track recommendation vs. execution performance

10. **3-month validation sufficient:** Phase 1 timeline long enough to prove profitability
   - **Validation:** 24-36 trades = statistically significant sample (if >60% win rate)
   - **Risk:** Medium—market conditions may not represent long-term
   - **Mitigation:** Extend validation if results inconclusive, test diverse market conditions

11. **Scaling viable (Phase 2):** System handles £100k+ without degradation
   - **Validation:** Architecture designed for scale
   - **Risk:** Low—position sizing and portfolio management scale linearly
   - **Mitigation:** Gradual capital increases (£10k → £25k → £50k → £100k)

12. **Productization demand exists (Phase 3):** Traders/investors will pay for signal service or invest in hedge fund
   - **Validation:** Existing market for signal services (Motley Fool, Seeking Alpha subscriptions)
   - **Risk:** High—untested go-to-market, regulatory uncertainty
   - **Mitigation:** Phase 1 & 2 validation first, gauge interest organically, FCA guidance clarity by 2026

### Critical Risks

**Technical Risks:**

1. **LLM Cost Overruns (HIGH RISK)**
   - **Scenario:** Agent analysis costs exceed £200/month budget
   - **Impact:** Phase 1 financially unviable
   - **Probability:** Medium (complex system, many API calls)
   - **Mitigation:**
     - Funnel approach (cheap screening → expensive deep analysis)
     - Aggressive caching (fundamentals don't change daily)
     - Model cascading (GPT-3.5 → GPT-4 only when needed)
     - Circuit breakers (halt if spending anomaly)
     - Daily cost monitoring dashboard

2. **Agent Coordination Failures (MEDIUM RISK)**
   - **Scenario:** Agents don't communicate effectively, signal convergence breaks
   - **Impact:** System produces low-quality recommendations
   - **Probability:** Medium (complex orchestration)
   - **Mitigation:**
     - Clear agent interfaces (standardized signal format)
     - Validation layers (schema checks)
     - LangSmith tracing (debug signal flow)
     - Graceful degradation (single agent failure doesn't kill workflow)

3. **Data Quality Issues (MEDIUM RISK)**
   - **Scenario:** APIs provide incorrect data (price errors, stale fundamentals)
   - **Impact:** Bad analysis → losing trades
   - **Probability:** Low (reputable APIs)
   - **Mitigation:**

     - Anomaly detection (price changes >50% flagged)
     - Manual review checkpoints (Longy sanity-checks recommendations)

4. **System Downtime (LOW RISK)**
   - **Scenario:** Overnight processing fails, no 7am report
   - **Impact:** Missed trading day
   - **Probability:** Low (<5% expected)
   - **Mitigation:**
     - Retry logic (exponential backoff for API failures)
     - State persistence (checkpointing, resume from failure)
     - Email alerts (notify Longy of failures)
     - Manual fallback (Longy can review previous day if needed)

**Market Risks:**

5. **Low Win Rate (HIGH RISK)**
   - **Scenario:** System win rate <60%, underperforms benchmarks
   - **Impact:** Phase 1 fails validation, project abandoned
   - **Probability:** Medium (unproven system)

     - Rigorous backtesting before live trading
     - Small position sizes initially (£500-1,000/trade)
     - Adversarial challenge system (prevents overconfidence)
     - Continuous improvement (analyze losing trades, refine agents)
     - Extend validation period if borderline (4-6 months vs. 3)

6. **Market Regime Change (MEDIUM RISK)**
   - **Scenario:** Market conditions shift (bull → bear, macro shock)
   - **Impact:** Strategy stops working, drawdowns exceed 15%
   - **Probability:** Low (3-month window)
   - **Mitigation:**
     - Macro Agent monitors regime shifts
     - Position sizing adjusts to volatility
     - Stop-losses limit downside (max 7-10% per trade)
     - Diversification (multiple sectors, styles)

7. **Black Swan Event (LOW PROBABILITY, HIGH IMPACT)**
   - **Scenario:** Unforeseen shock (Brexit-style, pandemic, war)
   - **Impact:** Portfolio drawdown >30%, stop-losses triggered en masse
   - **Probability:** Low (rare by definition)
   - **Mitigation:**
     - Capital preservation focus (Phase 1 small capital limits absolute loss)
     - Macro Agent early warning (geopolitical monitoring)
     - Emergency halt protocol (Longy can stop trading if systemic crisis)

**Business Risks:**

8. **Execution Gap (MEDIUM RISK)**
   - **Scenario:** Longy doesn't place trades as recommended (hesitation, override)
   - **Impact:** System performance not realized, validation compromised
   - **Probability:** Low (Longy committed)
   - **Mitigation:**
     - Track recommendation vs. execution performance
     - Automated trade execution (Phase 2)
     - Discipline protocol (commit to following system unless obvious error)

9. **Regulatory Uncertainty (PHASE 3 RISK)**
   - **Scenario:** FCA restricts AI-driven trading or hedge fund launches
   - **Impact:** Phase 3 productization blocked
   - **Probability:** Low (FCA encouraging innovation)
   - **Mitigation:**
     - Phase 1 & 2 focus (prove profitability first)
     - Engage legal counsel before Phase 3
     - Alternative paths (signal service doesn't require FCA authorization)
     - Monitor regulatory developments (FCA AI guidance 2025-2026)

10. **Competitor Response (PHASE 3 RISK)**
   - **Scenario:** Established players (Bloomberg, Refinitiv) launch multi-agent systems
   - **Impact:** Market saturation, competitive pressure
   - **Probability:** Low (12-18 month lag expected)
   - **Mitigation:**
     - First-mover advantage (build track record before competition)
     - UK specialization (niche focus vs. global platforms)
     - Cost advantage (£200/month vs. £24k Bloomberg)
     - Network effects (system learns from trades, improves over time)
