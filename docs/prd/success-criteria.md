# Success Criteria

Success is measured across three distinct phases with escalating validation thresholds:

**Phase 1: PROVE IT (Months 1-3) - Concept Validation**
- ✅ **Primary Success Metric:** 60%+ win rate with 8-12% average gain per winning trade
- ✅ **Volume Target:** 2-3 actionable trades per week (consistently generating opportunities)
- ✅ **Cost Containment:** Total operating costs ≤ £200/month (LLM + data APIs)
- ✅ **Capital Deployed:** £5,000-10,000 test capital
- ✅ **System Reliability:** Report delivered at configured time 95%+ of scheduled runs (default: 7am trading days)
- ✅ **Quality Gate:** Opportunities align with user judgment 80%+ of time (human validation)

**Phase 2: SCALE IT (Months 4-9) - Performance Validation**
- ✅ **Primary Success Metric:** 40%+ annualized returns (significantly beating FTSE 100)
- ✅ **Volume Target:** 5-10 trades per week with maintained quality
- ✅ **Capital Deployed:** £50,000-100,000
- ✅ **Risk Management:** Max drawdown ≤ 20%, Sharpe ratio > 1.5
- ✅ **Cost Efficiency:** Operating costs < 5% of profits generated
- ✅ **Portfolio Sophistication:** Successfully managing 15-20 concurrent positions

**Phase 3: PRODUCTIZE IT (Month 10+) - Business Validation**
- ✅ **Strategic Decision Point:** Launch hedge fund, signal service, or licensed fund product
- ✅ **Regulatory Compliance:** FCA authorization obtained (if hedge fund path)
- ✅ **Track Record:** 12+ months auditable performance data
- ✅ **Scalability Proven:** System handles £500k+ capital without performance degradation
- ✅ **Automation Maturity:** 90%+ trades executed without manual intervention

### Business Metrics

**Revenue/Value Metrics (Phase-Dependent):**
- **Phase 1:** Personal profit generation, system validation (no revenue target)
- **Phase 2:** £20k-50k personal trading profits demonstrating viability
- **Phase 3:** £100k+ personal profits OR service revenue (signal subscriptions, fund management fees)

**Cost Metrics:**
- **Data APIs:** EODHD All-In-One (~£85/month) + CityFALCON (~£30/month) + IBKR data feed (~£10/month) = ~£125/month
- **LLM Costs:** GPT-4o batch processing for 20 agents analyzing 10-15 stocks/day = ~£40-60/month
- **Infrastructure:** Cloud hosting (AWS/DigitalOcean) = ~£20-40/month
- **Total:** £185-225/month Phase 1, scaling to £300-500/month Phase 2 (still 99% cheaper than institutional £3000+/month)

**Engagement Metrics:**
- Daily morning report open rate (user engagement with recommendations)
- Trade approval rate (% of AI recommendations user agrees with)
- Watchlist utilization (how often watchlist triggers lead to trades)
- Signal convergence accuracy (when 4+ agents agree, what's the success rate?)

**Learning Metrics:**
- Win rate by signal strength threshold (optimize confidence scoring)
- Performance by agent combination (which agent groups most valuable?)
- Cost per analyzed stock (optimize funnel efficiency)
- Time saved vs. manual research (ROI calculation)
